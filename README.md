During my first web development course I had a term project assigned to me, which was to create a biographical site based on Jimmy Buffett. I had never heard his music before so I dedicated myself to researching his background, life, and what he's ontributed to music. I used CSS3, HTML5, and Wordpress for this project while sourcing my reseach from YouTube, Wikipedia, his personal site, and other sources.
