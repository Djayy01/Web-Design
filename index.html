         <h2>Early Life</h2>
         <article>
            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
            <p>Buffett was born on Christmas Day, 1946, in Pascagoula, Mississippi. During his grade school years, he attended St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone in the school band. As a child he was exposed to sailing through his grandfather and these experiences would go on to influence his later music.</p>

            <h3>Before The Fame</h3>
            <p>In 1969, he graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi with a bachelor's degree in history. At the university, he was involved in the Kappa Sigma, the largest college social fraternity in the world. When Jimmy saw how a fraternity brother in college with a guitar garnered the attention of the girls, he quickly learned a few basic chords and started playing himself. Suddenly Jimmy's world opened - while he still attended classes, he quickly had his first band and went from busking the streets of New Orleans to playing 6 nights a week at Bourbon Street clubs.</p>

        <h2>Musical Career</h2>
        <article>
           <h3>Early Career</h3>
           <p>After graduation, Jimmy Buffett worked as a correspondent for Billboard magazine in Nashville. He started his musical career in the late 1960s, and released his first album, <cite>”Down to Earth”</cite> in 1970. Key West in the 1970s was not the tourist-friendly town it is today – it was the last outpost of smugglers, con-men, artists, and free-spirits who simply couldn't run any further south in the mainland United States. It was there that the young musician thrown into the midst of this eclectic mix found his true voice as a songwriter - telling the stories of the wanderers, the adventurers and the forlorn. In 1974, his song <cite>"Come Monday"</cite> from the fourth studio album <cite>"Living and Dying in ¾ Time"</cite> entered the Billboard charts, eventually peaking at number 30. That year found Jimmy touring solo-acoustic and performing at well-known folk venues across the country, from the Troubadour in Los Angeles to Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He hasn't stopped touring since.</p>

           <h3>The Fame</h3>
           <p>His <cite>“Changes in Attitudes”</cite> album, released in 1977, featured the breakthrough hit song <cite>"Margaritaville"</cite>. Buffett began calling his music <em>"drunken Caribbean rock 'n' roll"</em> as he says on his 1978 live album <cite>“You Had To Be There”</cite>. Later, Buffett himself and others have used the term <em>"Gulf and Western"</em> to describe his musical style and that of other similar-sounding performers. The term is a play on the form of <em>"Country & Western"</em> and the name of the former conglomerate Gulf + Western. It catapulted Jimmy to national fame and, nearly a decade later, inspired Jimmy to launch a business empire. In 2000, Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band played on the White House lawn for then-President Bill Clinton. In 2003, he duetted with Alan Jackson for the song <cite>"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere"</cite>, which won a Country Music Association Award. In 2004, Buffett's album License to Chill topped the U.S. pop albums chart for the first time in his career.</p>

        <article>
           <h3>Charitable Work</h3>
           <p>The Save the Manatee Club was founded by Buffett and former Florida governor Bob Graham in 1981. One of the two manatees trained to interact with researchers at Mote Marine Laboratory is named Buffett after the singer. On November 23, 2004, Buffett raised funds with his Surviving the Storm hurricane relief concert in Orlando, Florida, to provide relief for hurricane victims in Florida, Alabama and the Caribbean affected by the four major hurricanes that year. In 2010, Buffett put on a free concert on the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama, in response to the BP oil disaster.</p>

His memoir <cite>A Pirate Looks at Fifty</cite>, published in 1998, went straight to number one on the nonfiction list. Buffett also co-wrote two children's books, <cite>The Jolly Mon</cite> and <cite>Trouble Dolls</cite>, with his eldest daughter, Savannah Jane Buffett.</p>
           <p>Buffett wrote the soundtrack for, and co-produced and played a role in, the 2006 film <cite>Hoot</cite>. Among his other film music credits are the theme song to the 1993 CBS television series <cite>Johnny Bago; "Turning Around"</cite> for the 1985 film <cite>Summer Rental</cite> starring John Candy; <cite>"I Don't Know (Spicoli's Theme)"</cite> for the film <cite>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</cite>.
